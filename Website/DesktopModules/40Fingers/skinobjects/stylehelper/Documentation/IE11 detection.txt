Hi Lance,

Not sure you have seen thison Skype:

I can reproduce it.. here's what I found:
You need a .net 4 patch or .net 4.5 to detect IE 11 correctly

But IE 11 now returns "internetexplorer" instead of "IE" as the borwser in asp.net (which is what I'm testing against)
So IfBrowser = "IE" for all but IE 11
IfBrowser = "internetexplorer" for IE 11 & up
They did this to stop people serving special content for IE :-s

BTW, changing the document mode in IE panel (F12) does not change the user agent.. 
It's not like the previous browser emulation.. (you have to switch that back on with a registry key)

I think it get's complicated for people if they have to use both 'ie' and 'internetexplorer' so I corrected that in a new release/

I uploaded the new version of the Style Helper, it will also return "ie" for IE 11.

Let me know if that helps :-)
